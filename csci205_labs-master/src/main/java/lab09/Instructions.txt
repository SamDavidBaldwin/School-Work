Instructions

The actual test folder is just the BoardSystem.java, running that file's main program will initialize a game instance that
can be played through to completion.
The game works on typing in colors in 4 color sequences as codes to try to guess a "master code"
At the start of the game, the user is asked how many guesses they would like the game to allow, and takes an integer
value. If the user enters a number less than 1, the number of guesses will default to 0. The default number of guesses
is 10.
After determining the number of guesses, the user is asked whether they would like a random code to be generated for
them, or if they would like to manually provide a code. If the user wants to cheat, the lines 83 and 88 can be
uncommented in the Mastermind.java file to reveal the code. (This would be something that I would make an option if I
spent more time).
The user is then asked to type in 4 colors, one at a time to formulate a guess at the "master code". After each guess,
the board (Array), is updated, and two numbers are provided to the user. The number of Correct Positions gives the user
the number of times they correctly guessed both the position and color of an object in the "master code". The number of
Correct Colors gives the number of times that the user guessed the correct color in the wrong position of the code.
