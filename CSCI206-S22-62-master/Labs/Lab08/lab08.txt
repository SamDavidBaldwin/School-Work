Prelab part 1):
    Given that the course_t structure actually initially gives a size of the character arrays that it is allocating for, it is larger
    as it already allocates that space rather than dynamically doing it. This may result in a large amount of unused space however,
    and therefore isn't always as space efficient. This is responsible for the majority of the size disparity as the portions that the
    two have in common are equivalent.
