What gcc flag is needed to generate debug information in your compiled program?
    -g --> Produce debug info
How do you set a breakpoint?
    break (line_number) or b (line_number)
How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
    next
If the next line of code is a function call, you'll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3. (If not, consider a different command for #3!) How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function instead? (If you changed your answer to #3, then that answer is most likely now applicable here.)
    step
How do you resume the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
    continue or c
How can you see the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
    print
How do you print a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
    info locals
How do you print a trace of how your program got to where it is?
    backtrace of bt

Lab Part 2:
    The issue with the existing code as it is currently is that it does not account for the theoretical possiblity of the list B terminating prior to the list A terminating, and as such if that case occurs will infinitely loop. As such, adding an or guard condition to the first if loop fixes the existing problem.
