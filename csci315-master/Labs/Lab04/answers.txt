1). While there are no explicit calls to fork, TCP sockets fundamentally function as a way for processes to communicate across networks. The fact that the process act, at their cores as a processes do, in that they share memory and communcate along that line, makes TCP a mechanism for interprocess communication.
2). Sockets are functionality that is provided by the kernel as the core behaviors are established within the actions of sockets see their roots in interacting with the base kernel to read and write and communicate. Every step that the sockets take from establishment to binding to listening to connecting is all communicated and instantiated within the framework of the kernel.
3). The main benefits that sockets provide are the ability to communicate across processes across the internet, and to bidirectionally communicate information. The main benefits of pipes are that they are significantly quicker as a result of utilizing less system calls, but they are unidirectional. There is no unique case in which one is bad to user and the other is good, but sockets can be used across computers and pipes should be used for fast communication within one system.
4). The gethostbyname() function returns a structure of type hostent when called whick allows for the program to acces a host by name. This is utilized in our program by giving us access to all types of information about our connection including IP and address type for the host.
5). A theoretical function that might replace gethostbyname is one that has more accurate information pertaining to the IP standards. Given the ways that the internet has changed on a base level may have made gethostbyname obselete, using a newer function like getaddrinfo() might be better.
