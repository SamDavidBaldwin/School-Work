----------------------------

Prelab: [30/30]
    Problem 1 [20/20]
        [5/5] Created the header file circular-list.h properly;
        [10/10] Implemented the functions defined in circular-list.h in the file circular-list.c properly so that the program adt-test works correctly;
        [5/5] Updated the Makefile properly.

    Problem 2 [10/10]
        [2/2] Describe succinctly the difference between mutex and semaphore;
        [4/4] Describe each of the library calls pthread_mutex_init, pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_mutex_unlock, sem_init 1 point each;
        [4/4] Describe the library calls sem_wait, sem_post 2 points each.

Lab: [70/70]
    Problem 1 [10/10]
        [10/10] Correctly restructure the call to rand_r so the random numbers can be correctly used in the usleep() call.

    Problem 2 [10/10]
        [10/10] Explain why rand_r is thread-safe.

    Problem 3 [30/30]
        [10/10] Put and initialize synchronization calls properly in the function circular_list_create();
        [10/10] Put and use synchronization calls properly in the function circular_list_insert();
        [10/10] Put and use synchronization calls properly in the function circular_list_remove().
        
    Problem 4 [20/20]
        [3/3] Read and use command line arguments correctly;
        [5/5] Define, initialize, and pass the parameters for the threads correctly;
        [12/12] Create the consumer and producer threads based on the command line arguments correctly so that the program works correctly.
