Theory of Universality came from Turing, and was put into practice by von Neumann
Programs in a high level language are compiled and translate into machine language, which is then interpreted by the CPU
The mnemonic form of the binary bits for an instruction are called assembly language 
    Assembly language will have an assembler that converts it to bit form 

Machine language oerations fall under specific groups
    Arithmetic, Logical and Flow operations

Machine languages differ in the total number of operations as well as different data types

Memory Hierarchy
Instead of one large memory pool, have scaled smaller and smaller but faster and faster memory in order to avoid issues of time accessing memory

Drivers for utilizing input devices like mice are within the CPU
A register is used to take input from these devices

In this language you can only compare to 0
    All branches are (if the value of this computation compared to zero)


The abstraction of the screen is just an array of binary (pixels) to represent na image 
There is a builtin chip which is just an 8k array called screen
Keyboard is stored as a keyboard chip which has an associated binary value to each of the values possible 

The Hack language has A instructions which are value or C instruction which are control 

Hack is case sensitive
