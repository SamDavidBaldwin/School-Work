This unit focuses around adding branching behavior
It also focuses on extending languages beyond their vanilla capabilities
    Like writing algorithms and calling them as functions\

The first ting discussed is goto which is the conditional branching for the language 
    To use goto, you need to push the condition to the stack before the if-goto command
    labels are used to distinghuish where to goto 

3 commands: 
    goto label, if goto label, label label
    only if-goto changes the stack


Vm language has primitive or fixed operations as well as abstract or extensible operations  
Like 90% of what they are saying is "you don't need to worry about this rn, we'll work on it later" 


Need to push a value onto the stack to return

The structure of the function call and return is a stack made up of smaller blocks 
    one block per function that hold the necessary information for that function
