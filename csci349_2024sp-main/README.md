# csci349_2024sp

My name is Samuel Baldwin and I am a senior Computer Science and Engineering major. 
This repo is for CSCI 349 -- Intro to Data Mining
I am a relative beginner to data mining but am prety comfortable with python/numpy due to other experience in other classes 
I'm looking to get amore solid understanding of the field of data mining before I graduate, given it is an increasingly important field in CS regardless of the job. 
I'm entirely usure of what I want to do after graduation, I'll figure that out alter in the semester.
